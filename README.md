# Translations

HODL.ZONE will support multiple languages, but for security and competitive reasons, we keep our source code private. We wish to support as many languages as possible, but run into issues as the developers only speak English. To try and broaden the potential userbase, we are open sourcing the text parts of our site in this repository. This allows users that speak more than 1 language to assist HODL.ZONE in our translation efforts. Please join our Slack if you wish to contribute.

# How?

There are multiple files with different extensions (.en, .fr, etc). If you are able to translate into french, let us know and we will add a french set of files with the text in english. You can than replace the text with the french version, and make a pull request into this repo. Or send us the files on slack. We will be sure to give you the proper credit and fee reductions.
